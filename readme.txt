AXEL

Axel is a library that makes flash game development as easy as possible. Axel takes advantage of Flash Player 11's Stage3D in order to offload all the rendering to the GPU in order to gain huge performance boosts over the typical flash display list. As of Adobe Air 3.2, Stage3D is also supported when building your games for mobile devices. This means exporting your flash games to iOS and Android has never been easier!

Axel is completely free, so download it and start making games today! Axel is released under the MIT license, so you don't have to worry about being restricted about what you can do with your games!
